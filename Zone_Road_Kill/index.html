  <h1>Bicycle Parking Locations in Cambridge </h1>


	  <p> Below is a map showing the designated locations of bicycle racks across Cambridge.
			The informaton was created through three methods: site surveys, detection through aerial imagry,
			and installation tracking. The data does not include bicycle parking on private
			property and excludes some racks that do not meet the cityâ€™s standards for rack design.

			 </p>
